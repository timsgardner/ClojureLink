(* mostly from http://clojure.org/reader *)

<word-H> = keyword | symbol | number | character | literal-tag

number = #"[0-9]+(?:\.[0-9]+)?(?:e[0-9]+)?"

keyword = #":.*"

(* This definition is laxer than usual because we've already eliminated a lot of annoying other cases by the time we get to this sub-grammar *)

symbol = #"[\w&&[^0-9][*+!-_?/.]].*"

character = #"\\.*"

literal-tag = #"#.*"
